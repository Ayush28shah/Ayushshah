         Hello, I'm Ayush Shah. I became interested in technology because I was curious about how things operated behind the scenes. I chose to pursue a career in IT because I've always been drawn to solving problems and figuring out how to make systems better. As I learned more about cloud computing, I realized that it was the ideal balance of opportunity and challenge.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          I've had the opportunity to use my system administration abilities and expand my understanding of AWS and Microsoft Azure while I'm a Cloud Computing student at George Brown College. I find it exciting that cloud technology is always changing because there is always something new to discover and create.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
           I'm excited to collaborate with like-minded people to solve practical issues and develop scalable solutions because I'm passionate about creating systems that have an impact. It seems like cloud computing is the way of the future, and I can't wait to be a part of it!
