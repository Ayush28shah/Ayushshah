            Hi, I'm Ayush Shah! My journey into the world of technology started with a curiosity about how things work behind the scenes. I’ve always been drawn to problem-solving and finding ways to improve systems, which is what led me to pursue a career in IT. Over time, I discovered the world of cloud computing and found it to be the perfect blend of challenge and opportunity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            I’m currently studying Cloud Computing at George Brown College, which has given me the chance to deepen my knowledge of AWS and Microsoft Azure, and strengthen my skills in system administration. The constantly evolving nature of cloud technology excites me because there’s always something new to learn and innovate.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            I’m passionate about building systems that make a difference, and I’m eager to work with like-minded individuals to solve real-world problems and create scalable solutions. Cloud computing feels like the future, and I’m excited to be part of that future!
